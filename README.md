# Ocular Disease Image Recognition

## Introduction
This repository contains the source code of our project with the Department of Computer Science, Kirori Mal College. The project aims to develop a deep learning model to classify the type of ocular disease from the fundus images of the eye. The model is trained on the [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/ocular-disease-recognition-odir5k?resource=download&select=full_df.csv).

## Folder Structure
```bash
├───Backend
|───DL-Project
├───Frontend
├───Practice
```
The Backend folder contains the code for the backend of the web application. The DL-Project folder contains the code for the deep learning model. The Frontend folder contains the code for the frontend of the web application. The Practice folder contains the code for the practice notebooks.
