# ODIR deep learning repository

## Introduction
This repository contains the source code of our project with the Department of Computer Science, Kirori Mal College. The project aims to develop a deep learning model to classify the type of ocular disease from the fundus images of the eye. The model is trained on the [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/ocular-disease-recognition-odir5k?resource=download&select=full_df.csv).
